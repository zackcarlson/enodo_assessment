# Enodo Assessment

To start server:
`npm run server-dev`

To start frontend:

1. All 1,500 properties must display on the map. Display the full address of the property in a hover window.

  \[x]

2. The user must be able to filter by the values in any column. Categorical values should be in a dropdown, and for numeric values the user should be able to enter a min and max value to filter.

- I was able to configure it such that you can filter by estimated market value, but not by the other categories.
- I was in the process of configuring the frontend and backend to query based off the selected attributes. 

3. Apply a color gradient to each point using the “estimated_market_value” column, lowest should be red, highest should be green.

4. Style should be similar to Vue.js element framework: https://element.eleme.io/#/en-US

- Implemented a React Bootstrap frontend
